# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

The initial forked and cloned repository contained the starter code for the project, which was then built upon to practice HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

Implemented one stretch aspect: "Write a new tweet" button in top right nav bar. If the textarea to compose a new tweet is not visible, clicking the button will scroll to and select the textarea to compose a new tweet. If the textarea is already visible, it will scroll down to the top of the tweet feed.
